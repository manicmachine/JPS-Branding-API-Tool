## Purpose
The JPS Branding API Tool is a Python Tkinter app meant to help admins make adjustments
to their iOS Self Service branding for devices running versions of Self Service
older than version 11.

❗ **NOTE: This app is provided as-is with no promise of support** ❗

## Run
A bundled executable/binary is provided as part of this repo. To run, just download
the binary for your platform and double-click.

## Running from source
While an executable version is provided for convenience, you can easily run
the tool from source. First, you'll need to have Python3 and Pip installed (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
Then, use Pip to install the required libraries with:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Once the requirements are installed, you can run the tool using:

`python3 ./main.py`

## Known Issues
- Tool needs to be relaunched if making changes to more than one JPS
